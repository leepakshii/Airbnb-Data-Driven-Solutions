#  Airbnb Data-Driven Solutions: Pricing & Insights

##  Overview
This project analyzes **Airbnb listings data** to extract insights on pricing, property characteristics, and customer behavior.  
The goal is to build a **data-driven pricing model** that helps optimize rental pricing and improve host strategies.

---

##  Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  

---

##  Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values  
   - Feature encoding (categorical → numerical)  
   - Outlier detection  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Popular neighborhoods  
   - Price distribution across property types  
   - Correlation between host type, reviews, and price  

3. **Modeling**
   - Linear Regression (baseline)  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
   - Model evaluation using RMSE and R² score  

4. **Insights**
   - What features affect Airbnb pricing the most  
   - Which neighborhoods/properties are most profitable  
   - Strategies for improving retention and customer satisfaction

##  Results
- **Linear Regression** → baseline performance  
- **Random Forest Regressor** → improved accuracy with lower RMSE  
- Key factors affecting price:  
  - Property type  
  - Location (neighborhood)  
  - Number of reviews  
  - Availability
